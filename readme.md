Hi bubby! ♡

Here is an updated README for your `secure_app` project. I hope this helps you!

# Secure App

Welcome to the Secure App project! This is a web application built with PHP, designed with security in mind. This document will guide you through the project structure, how to manage it with Git, and suggest ways to make it even better.

## Project Structure

Here is a detailed look at the files and folders in this project:

```
.
├── config/
│   └── db_config.php         # Holds the database connection settings.
├── database/
│   └── db_init.sql           # SQL script to set up the initial database schema.
├── public/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css         # Main stylesheet for the application.
│   ├── js/
│   │   └── main.js           # Main JavaScript file for frontend interactions.
│   ├── auth.php              # Handles authentication requests (like login/logout).
│   ├── index.php             # The main entry point of the application.
│   └── user.php              # Handles user-specific actions or profile pages.
├── src/
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── auth.php          # Core authentication logic (e.g., checking passwords).
│   │   └── security.php      # Functions for security features (e.g., input cleaning).
│   └── templates/
│       └── views/
│           ├── partials/
│           │   ├── footer.php      # Reusable footer content.
│           │   └── header.php      # Reusable header content.
│           ├── delete_account_form.php
│           ├── guest_home.php
│           ├── login_form.php
│           ├── privacy_policy.php
│           ├── register_form.php
│           └── welcome_dashboard.php
└── .gitignore                # Tells Git which files to ignore.
```

## How to Use Git

Git is a tool that helps you save your work and collaborate with others. Here are the three most common commands you will use.

### 1. Saving Your Changes (Commit)

When you've made changes to your code that you want to save, you create a "commit". Think of it like a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.

1.  **Stage your files:** First, tell Git which files you want to save. To add all changed files, use this command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
2.  **Commit your changes:** Now, save them with a descriptive message.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your descriptive message here"
    ```
    *Example: `git commit -m "Add user registration form"`*

### 2. Uploading Your Changes (Push)

To upload your saved commits from your computer to the GitHub repository, you use the `push` command. This makes your changes available to others.

```bash
git push
```

### 3. Getting the Latest Changes (Pull)

If someone else has made changes and pushed them to GitHub, you'll want to get those updates on your computer. The `pull` command downloads and merges the latest changes into your local project.

```bash
git pull
```
It's a good habit to `pull` before you start working to make sure you have the latest version of the code.

## How to Improve This Project
### You don't have to do all of these btw hehe
This project has a great start. Here are some suggestions to improve its structure, security, and functionality.

### 1. Enhance Security
*   **Prevent SQL Injection:** In your `db_config.php` and any files that talk to the database, make sure you are using prepared statements with PDO or MySQLi. This is the single most important thing to prevent database attacks. Never put variables directly into your SQL queries.
*   **Secure Passwords:** In `src/lib/auth.php`, when a user registers, use `password_hash()` to store their password. When they log in, use `password_verify()` to check it. Never store passwords as plain text.
*   **Sanitize User Input:** Use the functions in your `src/lib/security.php` file to clean all data that comes from users (forms, URL parameters, etc.). A good function to use for preventing XSS attacks is `htmlspecialchars()`. Every time you `echo` user data, wrap it in this function.
*   **Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** For all forms (login, register, delete account), add a hidden input with a unique, random token. When the form is submitted, check that the token matches. This ensures the request is coming from your site. You can create functions for this in `src/lib/security.php`.

### 2. Improve Code Organization

*   **Centralize the Router:** The files `auth.php`, `index.php`, and `user.php` in the `public/` folder are acting as entry points. A better approach is to have only `index.php` in the `public/` directory. This one file would act as a "router" that includes other files or calls functions based on the URL. This makes the application flow easier to manage and secures your other files by keeping them out of the public directory.
*   **Separate Logic from Presentation:** Your PHP files in `views/` should contain as little PHP logic as possible. They should mostly contain HTML and simple `echo` statements. The heavy lifting (getting data from the database, processing forms) should be done before the template file is included.

### 3. Adopt Modern Practices

*   **Use Composer:** Composer is a tool for managing dependencies in PHP projects. Even if you aren't using external libraries now, setting up Composer will make it easy to add them later. It also provides a powerful autoloader, which can automatically load your class files for you.
*   **Configuration Management:** Store sensitive information like database passwords in an environment file (a `.env` file) instead of directly in `db_config.php`. This is more secure because you can add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` so you don't accidentally commit secrets to the repository.
